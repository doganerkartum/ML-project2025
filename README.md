# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to predict the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

## 🔧 Key Features
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Cross-validation and performance metrics (accuracy, AUC, confusion matrix)
- Feature importance visualization and ROC curve analysis

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~88%
- AUC Score: ~0.91
- Balanced prediction with low false positive/negative rates

## 📁 Files Included
- `heart_disease_model.py`: Full code for training and evaluation
- `Heart_Disease_Report.docx`: Report with analysis, visuals, and explanations

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Report writing and result interpretation
